## Walkthrough for Phase 0

After the user starts the program, they will be prompted to signup for an account or login to an existing one. Supposing they are a new user, they type “s” to signup and are then asked to input a username, password, email, and their name. They type in appropriate values for each input respectively and then are asked to choose an action: create a workout schedule or quit the program. The user enters “c” to create a schedule and is asked what type of workout they want to add, what day it’s assigned to, and approximately how many calories they will burn from it. 
The user continues to add workouts until they are satisfied and enter “f.” Any remaining days without workouts will automatically be filled in as rest days.Then, the user gets a reminder of what workout is planned for each day of the schedule, and the program exits.
