## Spherical Miracle Group Project (FatBite)

This is a group project for CSC207 at University of Toronto. FatBite is a planner application that allows people to schedule workouts and meals. Users can signup or log into existing accounts and then make plans via a text interface. They will receive a text description of their schedule once they have finished making one.

To run the project, download all the files provided. Additionally, download the `.env` file provided and put it in the root folder for the project. Make sure to rename it to ".env" and not just "env."

After configuring the .env file, start the application by running the main method in App.java.
